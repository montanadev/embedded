This is a puzzle box to commemorate the '22 Q3 off-site. It has 4 puzzles to solve; the first three puzzles are easy, the fourth one is more involved. None of the solutions require opening the box or applying force.

If you solve all 4 puzzles, the Puzzle Box becomes a desktop clock!

# Notes

**The box might arrive broken**. The box is working properly if powering it produces a rainbow effect on the lid’s LEDs.

**To open the box**, cut the tape along the seams. Gently pry the tabs open on the bottom, and separate the two halves. You don’t need to open the box to solve the puzzles, and it might loosen the fragile connections inside. But there are some cool parts in here, so feel free to harvest them for your own projects!

**The bootloader button** is exposed on the bottom for flashing your own code.
